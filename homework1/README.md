## How to execute a program?

1) From python3 

You have to write "python3 " + the number of the program that you want to check.
For example:

    python3 Hauss.py 

2) Jupyter

You have to write "jupyter notebook " and of the homework that you want to check.
Secondly, you must add ".ipynb" to the note.
For example:
  
    jupyter notebook homework1.ipynb

To execute the programs in Jupyter press button-combination Shift+Enter.

## Explain the programs
### Hauss
Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm in linear algebra for solving a system of linear equations.
It is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.
Row operations
See also: Elementary matrix
There are three types of elementary row operations which may be performed on the rows of a matrix:

Swap the positions of two rows.
Multiply a row by a non-zero scalar.
Add to one row a scalar multiple of another.

If the matrix is associated to a system of linear equations, then these operations do not change the solution set. 
Therefore, if one's goal is to solve a system of linear equations, then using these row operations could make the problem easier. 
    
 ### Sweep 
 In numerical linear algebra, the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, also known as the Thomas algorithm (named after Llewellyn Thomas), is a simplified form of Gaussian elimination that can be used to solve tridiagonal systems of equations. A tridiagonal system for n unknowns may be written as

    a i x i âˆ’ 1 + b i x i + c i x i + 1 = d i , {\displaystyle a_{i}x_{i-1}+b_{i}x_{i}+c_{i}x_{i+1}=d_{i},\,\!} a_{i}x_{i-1}+b_{i}x_{i}+c_{i}x_{i+1}=d_{i},\,\!

where a 1 = 0 {\displaystyle a_{1}=0\,} a_{1}=0\, and c n = 0 {\displaystyle c_{n}=0\,} c_{n}=0\,
