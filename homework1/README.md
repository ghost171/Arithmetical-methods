## How to execute a program?

1) From python3 

First, you have to write "python3 homework" + the number of a homework than want to check.
Then, you should write "/" and the name of the program that you want to check.
For example:

    python3 homework1/Hauss.py 

WARNING: The programs in homework3 folder can't be executed from the home folder.
To execute this you must go to the folder by the command:

    cd homework3
    
Also, you can go to another folder whatever you want, by switching folder's name after "cd ".

2) Jupyter

First, you have to write "jupyter notebook homework" + the number of a homework than want to check.

Finally, you must add ".ipynb" to the note.
For example:
  
    jupyter notebook homework1/homework1.ipynb
