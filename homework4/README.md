## How to execute a program?

1) From python3 

You have to write "python3 " + the number of the program that you want to check.
For example:

    python3 Hauss.py 

2) Jupyter

You have to write "jupyter notebook " and of the homework that you want to check.
Secondly, you must add ".ipynb" to the note.
For example:
  
    jupyter notebook homework1.ipynb

To execute the programs in Jupyter press button-combination Shift+Enter.
## What do this programs

In physics and mathematics, the heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes how the distribution of some quantity (such as heat) evolves over time in a solid medium, as it spontaneously flows from places where it is higher towards places where it is lower. It is a special case of the diffusion equation.

This equation was first developed and solved by Joseph Fourier in 1822 to describe heat flow. 
However, it is of fundamental importance in diverse scientific fields. In probability theory, the heat equation is connected with the study of random walks and Brownian motion, via the Fokker–Planck equation. 
In financial mathematics, it is used to solve the Black–Scholes partial differential equation. 
In quantum mechanics, it is used for finding spread of wave function in potential free region. 
A variant was also instrumental in the solution of the longstanding Poincaré conjecture of topology.

Meaning of the equation

Informally, the Laplacian operator ∇^2 gives the difference between the average value of a function in the neighborhood of a point, and its value at that point. 

Thus, if u is the temperature, ∇^2 tells whether (and by how much) the material surrounding each point is hotter or colder, on the average, than the material at that point.

By the second law of thermodynamics, heat will flow from hotter bodies to adjacent colder bodies, in proportion to the difference of temperature and of the thermal conductivity of the material between them. 

When heat flows into (or out of) a material, its temperature increases (respectively, decreases), in proportion to the amount of heat divided by the amount (mass) of material, with a proportionality factor called the specific heat capacity of the material.

Therefore, the equation says that the rate u' at which the material at a point will heat up (or cool down) is proportional to how much hotter (or cooler) the surrounding material is. 

The coefficient α  in the equation takes into account the thermal conductivity, the specific heat, and the density of the material. 

Character of the solutions

The heat equation implies that peaks (local maxima) of u will be gradually eroded down, while depressions (local minima) will be filled in. 

The value at some point will remain stable only as long as it is equal to the average value in its immediate surroundings. 

In particular, if the values in a neighborhood are very close to a linear function Ax + By + Cz + D , then the value at the center of that neighborhood will not be changing at that time (that is, the derivative u').

A more subtle consequence is the maximum principle, that says that the maximum value of u {\displaystyle u} u in any region R of the medium will not exceed the maximum value that previously occurred in R, unless it is on the boundary of R. 

That is, the maximum temperature in a region R can increase only if heat comes in from outside R. This is a property of parabolic partial differential equations and is not difficult to prove mathematically (see below).

Another interesting property is that even if u initially has a sharp jump (discontinuity) of value across some surface inside the medium, the jump is immediately smoothed out by a momentary, infinitesimally short but infinitely large rate of flow of heat through that surface. 

For example, if two isolated bodies, initially at uniform but different temperatures u0 and u1, are made to touch each other, the temperature at the point of contact will immediately assume some intermediate value, and a zone will develop around that point where u will gradually vary between u0 and u1.

If a certain amount of heat is suddenly applied to a point the medium, it will spread out in all directions in the form of a diffusion wave. Unlike the elastic and electromagnetic waves, the speed of a diffusion wave drops with time: as it spreads over a larger region, the temperature gradient decreases, and therefore the heat flow decreases too.
